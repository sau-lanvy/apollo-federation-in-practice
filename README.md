# apollo-federation-in-practice
This repository will show you how to build a simple e-commerce system containing checkout, inventory, orders, products, reviews and accounts subgraphs using Apollo Federation

## What's Inside
This repo will guide you how to build distributed GraphQL APIs from scratch with Typescript and it does so using a practical, project-based approach. Working through this from start to finish will leave you with a relatively full-featured GraphQL API that resolves data from several different back-end services.

## Local Development
### Software requirements
- Install the latest LTS version of Node (preferably using nvm)
- Install bun (optional)
### Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
### Running the subgraphs and Router
You can switch to each subgraphs and run the command:
```
npm run dev
```
